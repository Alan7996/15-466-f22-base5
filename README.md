How To Play:

Press WASD to move and use mouse to look around.

In this acid world you are confined to this small square area.
If you attempt to leave and hit a wall, you will die.
The only way for you to survive this apocalyptic scenario is to survive the 
full duration of acidic rain pour.
Make sure to dodge all incoming acidic rain drops and survive without touching 
the four walls.
